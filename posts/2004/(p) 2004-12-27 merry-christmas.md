Ahhh, Christmas, a time for food, family, and of course, gifts. Some of my
friends this year, however, are giving me gifts that **cost** me money. These
gifts come in the form of mobile phone text messages, which are not included
in my cell phone plan. T-Mobile charges me 50 cents a pop for every one sent
**and** received. Many of my friends have sent me Christmas greetings the past
few days via text message, and I can just see the ogres at T-Mobile jumping
with glee as my bill skyrockets. Oh well. At least I have friends.
