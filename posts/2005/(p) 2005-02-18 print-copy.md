I posted a new PDF copy of my novel on the site that is formatted for
printing. You can also read it on the screen, of course, but I wanted to print
out couple of copies with nice typesetting to give to a couple of my
professors. Anyway, enjoy. Also, I added a disclaimer, since there's some
objectionable material in there and I think it's fair to notify the reader
beforehand. Finally, I am working on a write-up of the entire NaNoWriMo
experience and will post it as soon as I get a chance. Bottom line, though: I
recommend it.
