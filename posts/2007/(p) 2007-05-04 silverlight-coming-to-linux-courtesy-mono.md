According to [an article over at news.com][1], the [Mono project][2] founder
says they'll be working on a Linux port of Silverlight in the future. Sweet! I
was personally annoyed to find out that "cross-platform" only meant Mac and
Windows when Silverlight was officially announced. But it's nice to see Mono
committing to filling the Linux gap. Best of luck to them!
