I just linked to a piece that I got via [Lukas Mathis][], but I wanted to explicitly encourage you to read his stuff. In my opinion, [ignorethecode.net][Lukas Mathis] should be required reading for anyone doing user experience design today. Very smart, very insightful, very well-reasoned. Solid work.
