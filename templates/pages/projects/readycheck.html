            ## Overview

            ReadyCheck is a [Django][]-based web application designed to make managing raids in
            World of Warcraft easier -- and prettier. I got sick of the crappy PHP-based raid managers out there,
            so I decided I could do better.

            Will be licensed under the MIT license, but source code isn't yet available.
