        ## Overview

        At its core, Engineer is a static website generator. In other words,
        Engineer let's you build a website from a bunch of files -- articles written
        in [Markdown][], templates, and other stuff -- and outputs *another* bunch
        of files -- HTML, mostly -- that you can then copy wherever you want.

        But Engineer has some pretty nifty features that you might find
        enticing. Learn more about Engineer, including how to install it, at
        <http://engineer.readthedocs.org/>, or check out the source at
        [github](https://github.com/tylerbutler/engineer).

        You can also check out [the source for tylerbutler.com][1] for an example of what an
        Engineer-based site looks like under the covers.
