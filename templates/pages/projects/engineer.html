            ## Overview

            At its core, Engineer is a static website generator. In other words,
            Engineer let's you build a website from a bunch of files -- articles written
            in [Markdown][], templates, and other stuff -- and outputs *another* bunch
            of files -- HTML, mostly -- that you can then copy wherever you want.

            But Engineer has some pretty nifty features that you might find
            enticing. Learn more about Engineer, including how to install it, at
            <http://engineer.readthedocs.org/>, or check out the source at
            [github](https://github.com/tylerbutler/engineer).
