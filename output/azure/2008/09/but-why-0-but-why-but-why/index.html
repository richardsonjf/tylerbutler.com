                                    <p>I love hearing stories. When I was growing up I used to love when people would
visit and my Dad would tell some of his stories. Even though I had heard most
of them a thousand times, it was awesome to sit back and watch other people
experience them for the first time. I also read a lot of stories growing up,
and I developed a special love for short stories in particular (I especially
like O.&nbsp;Henry).</p>
<p>While I was in college, I discovered a site that I have since lost many hours
of my life to &#8211; <a href="http://www.folklore.org/">folklore.org</a>. It&#8217;s a site put together by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hertzfeld">Andy
Hertzfeld</a> (not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hertzfeldt">Don Hertzfeldt</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejected">Rejected</a>
fame), and contains &#8220;anecdotes about the development of Apple&#8217;s original
Macintosh computer, and the people who created it.&#8221; It is incredible &#8211; it
combines my love of stories with a topic I find interesting &#8211; the early days
of personal computing. Best of all, the stories there are written by the
people who experienced it, and often contain a healthy dose of humor and
humanity. But behind that, there&#8217;s some cool technical details about the
challenges the engineers faced, and why some of the decisions got made the way
they did. I find that part of it utterly&nbsp;spellbinding.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been on the lookout for other sites like this for other tech companies,
like Atari or even Microsoft. The closest I&#8217;ve found for Atari is
<a href="http://www.dadhacker.com/">DadHacker.com</a>, written by a guy who worked for Atari back in the day. His
blog is interesting in a variety of ways, but I particularly like his Atari
posts. In fact, his post titled <a href="http://www.dadhacker.com/blog/?p=987">Donkey Kong and Me</a> was what got him into
my <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader permanently. It&#8217;s good &#8211; you should read&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I actually work with a developer who was also on the team that developed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clippy">Clippy</a>, and I&#8217;ve heard some interesting stories for him about what that
was like. Maybe I&#8217;ll try to convince him to write up some of his experiences&#8230;
I am sure there are some more great stories out there… If you know of some
sites, please do point me to&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Because I find this stuff so interesting, I thought it would be good to start
chronicling some of the stuff I know about because I&#8217;ve been working on
SharePoint. Thus, I plan to write a series titled &#8220;But Why?&#8221; about various
SharePoint features that I either worked on or have been exposed to, and why
they behave the way they do. These posts will be one part SharePoint history,
one part storytelling, and if I do it right, will pull back the curtain a bit
so you can see just why things wound up the way they&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>But first, some disclaimers: These posts are my own thoughts and opinions, and
do not reflect those of Microsoft or of anyone else who works/worked on
SharePoint. Also, my memory may be fuzzy and blatantly incorrect about some
things, so everything should be viewed through that lens. Finally, you
shouldn&#8217;t expect these posts to be as interesting as anything you read on&nbsp;folklore.org.</p>
