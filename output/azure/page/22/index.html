                                    <p>Someone came by my office today and asked me if I could show him how to make a
column on a SharePoint list required. No problem! While this isn&#8217;t as simple
as it could be, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. Go into the list you want to
change, select <strong>List Settings</strong> from the <strong>Settings</strong> drop down, then click
the column you want to change in the <strong>List Settings</strong> page. You should see an
option called &#8220;Require that this column contains information.&#8221; By default,
this is off, but turning it on will make the column&nbsp;required.</p>
<p>However, in this case, that option wasn&#8217;t showing in the <span class="caps">UI</span>. The reason was
that the column was a <strong>Yes/No (check box)</strong> field. Now, if you think about
it, this makes sense. A checkbox <em>always</em> has state, either checked or
unchecked, so it&#8217;s by nature required. A user always has to fill in a checkbox
with some data, either by checking it or unchecking it. It all comes down to
the default state, which <em>is</em> settable in the SharePoint&nbsp;<span class="caps">UI</span>.</p>
<p>The interesting thing here, though, is that the user didn&#8217;t stop to think
about this. And that makes sense. He just wanted to make a column required; he
didn&#8217;t think about what type of column it was. SharePoint totally removes the
required field setting from the <span class="caps">UI</span> for Yes/No fields because it doesn&#8217;t make
sense. However, the user got confused. He wasn&#8217;t sure if the <span class="caps">UI</span> was missing by
design or if he wasn&#8217;t looking in the right spot for the setting. If you have
a task to accomplish using relatively unfamiliar <span class="caps">UI</span>, you go to the place that
makes sense to you, but you&#8217;re never sure you&#8217;re in the right place. In this
case, the user poked around other parts of the <span class="caps">UI</span> before coming to me, because
he thought he was looking in the wrong&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>This might be alleviated by disabling (i.e. graying out) the part of the <span class="caps">UI</span>
that is not applicable. This is somewhat clearer, because it says, &#8220;Yes, this
is where you would change this setting, but it doesn&#8217;t make sense here or is
not allowed.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t a hard rule. You can&#8217;t <em>always</em> display <em>all</em>
possible settings in one piece of <span class="caps">UI</span> because if there are a large number of
settings, things can get confusing and distracting. Some hiding does make
sense in many cases. But it is worth some dedicated thought about your <span class="caps">UI</span> and
what your users are trying to accomplish when deciding whether to hide a piece
of <span class="caps">UI</span> or simply gray it&nbsp;out.</p>

                                    <p>My site has been going up and down lately. It&#8217;s not a problem with <span class="caps">MOSS</span> or the
server. Both have stayed up and running without any problems. Unfortunately,
the environment that my server is in has been having problems with their
switch. Apparently it&#8217;s rebooting itself constantly, which is &#8220;a common issue
for this brand and model of router.&#8221; Anyway, no biggie, my site isn&#8217;t exactly
mission-critical. But weekends are the best time for me to work on
enhancements, and I have a few in mind that I was looking forward to getting
set up. Alas, &#8216;twas not to be. Everything seems to be working now, though, so
hopefully it&#8217;ll stay this&nbsp;way.</p>

                                    <p>I upgraded to Acrobat Reader 8 last night because frankly, I figured it
couldn&#8217;t get any crappier than 7. I was right. In fact, it got a bit better.
The Yahoo toolbar and advertising bar across the top seem to be gone. The
interface is simpler, too. It still has automatic updating on by default, of
course, which I immediately turned off just in case the update feature sucks
as much as it did in&nbsp;7.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s getting better. But even without Photoshop Album Starter Edition,
which it tries to bundle with the download by default (freakin&#8217; annoying, by
the way), it&#8217;s still <strong>20.8 <span class="caps">MB</span></strong>. My goodness, that&#8217;s&nbsp;bloated&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>Several of my banks have been &#8220;upgrading&#8221; their security since the beginning
of the year. I have pretty much accepted the fact that &#8220;upgrading&#8221; security
means my blood pressure will needlessly rise the next time I try to access my&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>The latest security craze seems to be these security questions. &#8220;Mother&#8217;s
maiden name&#8221; apparently doesn&#8217;t cut it anymore. Security questions drive me
insane, because there&#8217;s invariably a finite set of options I have to choose
from. <em>Favorite childhood superhero?</em> <em>Name of firstborn child?</em> What is this
crap? <strong>None</strong> of it is easy for me to remember! Why don&#8217;t you let me pick my
<strong>own</strong> question and my <strong>own</strong> answer? Now I have to remember some &#8220;fact&#8221;
that I made up as an arbitrary answer to some stupid question that a bank
decided was an excellent way to distinguish me from some sorry&nbsp;thief.</p>

                                    <p>My pledge bro Craig &#8220;Rizzy&#8221; Rohe also has a Wii, and he sent me some mini-reviews on some games. Since he has no online presence (yet), I thought I&#8217;d
post them. But before I do that, here&#8217;s what he has to say about getting
online with the&nbsp;thing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, some bitching about&nbsp;Wii:</p>
<p>Up until 10 minutes ago, all I&#8217;ve ever done with the Wii is played games.
Very easy, very fun. However, trying to use the internet connectivity and
adding friends made me want to punch a little Japanese person in the face. Do
they actually expect average people to be able to do this? I&#8217;m an embedded
systems designer, and I was frustrated with it. Other than letting our Mii&#8217;s
travel back and forth, is there even any benefit to doing it? Shame on you&nbsp;Nintendo.</p>
<p>Second, games only save to the internal Wii memory. If you want them on the
<span class="caps">SD</span> card, you have to copy it over manually. Of course, you&#8217;d have to do that
each time you play the game in order to keep the <span class="caps">SD</span> card up to date. It pretty
much makes the $50 1G memory card I bought completely&nbsp;useless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself. The Wii online setup is pretty bad. I&#8217;m
really surprised people are getting it to work without wanting to gouge their
own eyes out with a spoon. As for me, I am still using it on my neighbor&#8217;s
wireless because it won&#8217;t work on mine. And yes, I have changed to channels
1/11 on the router. Yes, I have followed all stupid suggestions in the forums
and on the support site. Nintendo could take a few pointers from Microsoft in
this particular part of the&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">SD</span> thing seems strange. I haven&#8217;t tried to use an <span class="caps">SD</span> card yet, but it does
seem odd that you can&#8217;t save games directly to it. This does seem like
something Nintendo could change with a firmware update&nbsp;though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Wii Sports</strong> &#8211; It&#8217;s ok. Fun little games to showcase the controller
abilities. I&#8217;ve found tennis to be pretty fun with multiple people, and you
can avoid the dreaded Wii tennis elbow once you learn that a skilled flick of
the wrist will do just as much as a full blown swing. I brought my Wii home
for Christmas, and since I have a zillion siblings we had continuously
rotating doubles matches which were a&nbsp;blast.</p>
<p><strong>Super Monkey Ball</strong> &#8211; I usually only play the mini games. Not as much fun
as the versions for GameCube. I think they tried too hard to incorporate the
motion control into the games, and many of them are just too touchy, or they
should have put more time into making it fun. I guess they were pressed for
time trying to get that one out for launch. There are a few that are pretty
entertaining&nbsp;though.</p>
<p><strong>Zelda: Twilight Princess</strong> &#8211; This game rocks. It&#8217;s hella fun to play. They
used the motion sensors in moderation, which is good. The game itself is
really fun - plenty of puzzles and tangent adventures to try out. I haven&#8217;t
played any Zelda games since the one for 8-bit Nintendo, but I can still
blindly say this is probably the best to&nbsp;date.</p>
<p><strong>Excite Truck</strong> &#8211; So much fun my head almost exploded. It&#8217;s a very fast
paced, physics defying game. There&#8217;s actually a lot of strategy needed for the
more advanced tracks, but at the same time you can just pick a level and have
fun doing 720&#8217;s at 1000 ft in the air and smashing through trees with power-
ups. Definitely one of the best games I&nbsp;own.</p>
<p><strong>Red Steel</strong> &#8211; I haven&#8217;t played this game very much. The reason? My damn
arm gets tired. Another example of how not to design a game interface. I think
it would be much better if I could play for more than 20 mins at a time, so my
review may be biased. Basically, you are required to use the Wii-mote pointer
continuously to aim and steer in the game. That&#8217;s not even too bad because you
could rest your arm on your knee; then they thought up the great idea of
requiring you to extend your arm towards the <span class="caps">TV</span> to zoom in/out. Combine all of
that movement and you have to hold your arm straight out for extended periods
of time during game play. Very annoying. Maybe I need to hit the&nbsp;gym.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Haven&#8217;t gotten into Twilight Princess yet myself. Elebits should be here from
<a href="http://www.gamefly.com/">Gamefly</a> this week, though in retrospect maybe I should have put Excite
Truck at the top of my queue instead. Oh well, way too many awesome games
these days to get to. I still work occasionally, you&nbsp;know.</p>
