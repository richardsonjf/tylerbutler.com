                                    <p>Lots to talk about in this rant. I first heard of the Illinois Governor&#8217;s plan
to increase tolls in Illinois one day when I was driving to work. And this
isn&#8217;t a small increase, either &#8211; the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:B6k2O8uaf5sJ:www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-toll26.html&amp;hl=en">tolls are doubling</a>! Unless you get
an <span class="caps">IPASS</span>, of course. The solution, obviously, is to get an <span class="caps">IPASS</span>.
Unfortunately, that in and of itself presents a bit of a problem. You see,
<span class="caps">IPASS</span> tracks you. That&#8217;s my biggest beef with it. I understand the argument
that it &#8220;makes things faster&#8221; and reduces congestion, but it also records
<strong>where I go</strong>. Check the <a href="http://www.illinoistollway.com/portal/page?_pageid=53,34586,53_34725:53_34734&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL"><span class="caps">FAQ</span> </a>at their website. One part&nbsp;reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I-<span class="caps">PASS</span> users can log onto www.getipass.com or link to the online maintenance
function through the general Illinois Tollway Web site at
www.illinoistollway.com to update credit card information, add a new vehicle
to the account, or <strong>even check on recent I-<span class="caps">PASS</span>&nbsp;transactions.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bugs me. I have no intention of ever getting arrested or anything, but if
for some reason I was, I&#8217;m fairly certain my <span class="caps">IPASS</span> records could be pulled and
used against me. This makes me angry. And despite the fact that the Tollway
Authority says they don&#8217;t track users speeds to issue tickets, I don&#8217;t trust
them. Didn&#8217;t RealNetworks claim their player wasn&#8217;t spyware at one point?
Anyway, you won&#8217;t see me buying an&nbsp;<span class="caps">IPASS</span>.</p>
<p>The day after I learned about this I decided to finally go and get my Chicago
Card, which can be used as a fare card on <span class="caps">CTA</span> busses and trains. Since I&#8217;m a
part-time student now, I don&#8217;t get a U-<span class="caps">PASS</span>, and I ride the train enough to
warrant getting one. But that made me realize the similarities between the
Toll situation and the Chicago Card. You no longer get a 10% bonus in funds
when you add 10 or more dollars to your regular <span class="caps">CTA</span> fare card &#8211; you only get
the bonus when you have a Chicago Card. But the Chicago Card is tied to your
name, so tracking is possible. With the regular fare card, they can track the
use of the card, but they can&#8217;t tie it to any one person. That&#8217;s the way I
like it. I submitted a question to the <span class="caps">CTA</span> people asking about the privacy and
information collection policies of the Chicago Card, and here&#8217;s the response I&nbsp;got:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Mr.&nbsp;Butler:</p>
<p>Thank you for your inquiry. The <span class="caps">CTA</span> does not track the use of these cards by
any individual unless requested by that individual. The Chicago Card Plus does
provide its users with an online record of their usage, but each customer has
a password of his or her own selection to access the information. The regular
Chicago Card does not offer this online&nbsp;service.</p>
<p>If a law enforcement agency wishes to review our records, it can do so with
the official, lawful use of a warrant, court order,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Thank you for your&nbsp;interest.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Terry Levin<br />
<span class="caps">CTA</span> Customer&nbsp;Service</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t really answer my question. So no tracking is done
&#8220;unless requested?&#8221; But what if law enforcement has a warrant to pull their
records? Is Mr. Levin saying the information doesn&#8217;t exist (i.e. users aren&#8217;t
tracked), or that it exists and isn&#8217;t used for any other purpose other than
for posterity&#8217;s sake? I don&#8217;t know. But it looks like no Chicago Card, Plus or
not, for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Finally, I came across <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/09/2217232&amp;tid=158&amp;tid=103&amp;tid=1&amp;tid=17">this story</a> on Slashdot. Apparently the city is
considering rolling out a whole bunch of cameras in the city and tying them
into the 911 call center. All good, in theory, right? It&#8217;ll help deter crime,
right? I don&#8217;t think so. Why not just put up more street lights? A bright
light is the biggest deterrant to random crime. But that would be too simple,
I guess. And lights can&#8217;t track&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Do I sound paranoid? I am. I don&#8217;t trust the government. They&#8217;ve given me no
reason to. And government is universally corrupt, be it a national government,
a local government, or even a school administration. So it looks like I&#8217;ll be
paying a lot more than the rest of you for the same services. Yes, it&#8217;s my
choice, but the government shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to charge me for my&nbsp;freedom.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s&nbsp;worth.</p>

                                    <p>The article is in the form of a sort of sci-fi story, and is only one of
several articles (I think) that were published by the <a href="http://www.acm.org"><span class="caps">ACM</span></a>. I&#8217;m not the
biggest fan of Stallman (he&#8217;s far too big a hippie for my tastes), but I think
the article&#8217;s use of extremes illustrates some excellent points about the
tendency of government to get all up in our electronic business. Anyway, I
enjoyed it. At first glance, it seems very outlandish, but when you think
about it and read the author&#8217;s notes, it becomes clear that the sad future
isn&#8217;t far&nbsp;away.</p>

address? I&#8217;d like to invite him to my apartment-warming party. Betcha he does
an awesome keg-stand. He&#8217;s probably been arrested though &#8211; he&#8217;s well under the

<blockquote>
<p>A black bear was found passed out at a campground in Washington state
recently after guzzling down three dozen cans of a local beer, a campground
worker said on&nbsp;Wednesday.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>We noticed a bear sleeping on the common lawn and wondered what was going on
until we discovered that there were a lot of beer cans lying around,&#8221; said
Lisa Broxson, a worker at the Baker Lake Resort, 80 miles (129 km) northeast
of&nbsp;Seattle.</p>
<p>The hard-drinking bear, estimated to be about two years old, broke into
campers&#8217; coolers and, using his claws and teeth to open the cans, swilled down
the&nbsp;suds.</p>
<p>It turns out the bear was a bit of a beer sophisticate. He tried a mass-market
Busch beer, but switched to Rainier Beer, a local ale, and stuck with it for
his drinking&nbsp;binge.</p>
<p>Wildlife agents chased the bear away, but it returned the next day, said&nbsp;Broxson.</p>
<p>They set a trap using as bait some doughnuts, honey and two cans of Rainier
Beer. It worked, and the bear was captured for&nbsp;relocation.</p>

                                    <p>I have been looking for a new apartment for what seems like forever. I started
out with 5 other roommates, but when they decided to go into a house that just
wasn&#8217;t up to my standards, I struck out on my own and started looking for one-
bedroom places. Unfortunately, the search was tough. Many places I looked at
were either in fairly bad shape or just too expensive for the size. I was
getting pretty discouraged, especially since my financial situation isn&#8217;t
exactly great and time was running&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>On Saturday of last week (August 7) I looked at a 2 1/2 room studio apartment
on Hamilton Avenue, close to the corner of 35th and Archer. I liked what I saw
- and I liked the price, too. It was a little further from campus than I had
hoped (about a 15-minute drive, depending on the lights), but it had beautiful
hardwood floors, a large walk-in closet, and was in pretty good shape. It also
smelled great, which, considering some of the other places I looked at, was a
definite plus. The landlord was understanding of my financial situation, and I
explained to him that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to pay until later the following week
because <a href="/2004/08/i-hate-banks/">my bank is stupid</a>. That was fine with him, so I crossed my
fingers and waited until Friday so my bank would finally ackowledge that I had
the necessary funds in my account (have I mentioned yet that <a href="/2004/08/i-hate-banks/">I despise
banks?</a>).</p>
<p>Thankfully (and miraculously), my bank cleared the funds just before I needed
to make the withdrawal for the security deposit and first month&#8217;s rent. I
headed over to the landlord&#8217;s office, got everything in order, and had the
keys in my hand in less than an hour. It felt really good to have the keys in
my hand. I grabbed Alex&#8217;s camera and headed over to get some pictures before I
destroyed the place with my stuff. Some of the best ones are here. Others are
available in the download section. Click on the photos below to get an
even bigger&nbsp;photo.</p>

                                    <p>I hate banks. I despise them. I wish a plague of death and disease upon them.
The concept of a bank seems simple, and indeed, useful, at least at first.
People have money that they want to secure somehow so their money doesn&#8217;t get
stolen from under their mattress or out of their wallets. So they give their
money to an <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/">insured</a> &#8220;corporation&#8221; of sorts that holds their money and
keeps a record of how much they have. For large transactions, the account
holder can write a check for the amount of money they want to transfer to
another party and sign it. The &#8220;corporation,&#8221; (aka the bank) honors the
request to transfer and handles the details so that the account holder doesn&#8217;t
have to. This is simple, right? This is &#8220;protecting ourselves,&#8221;&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Maybe, maybe not. In my experience, banks are nothing but hassle, especially
for people like me that have very limited funds available and need to bleed
our accounts dry about every week or so. <a href="http://www.iit.edu">Illinois Tech</a> pays me every two
weeks with a check that I deposit to my checking account at <a href="http://www.lakesidebank.com">Lakeside
Bank</a>. These checks are <strong>not</strong> out of state (obviously); In fact, they&#8217;re
drawn from Lakeside Bank! <em>So why does it take a <strong>week</strong> for my deposit to
show up in my&nbsp;account?</em></p>
<p>This was the question I set out to answer a couple of weeks ago. The problem
arose when I made an electronic bill payment after making a deposit that my
online account information reported had been deposited and was available. The
bank charged me an overdraft fee, claiming that the deposited funds were on
hold, even though the account screen online clearly said that the funds were
available. I called the bank and was given the basic&nbsp;run-around:</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>This person is who you need to talk&nbsp;to.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Phone transfer. Wait for a&nbsp;while.</em></p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>No, it&#8217;s so and&nbsp;so.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Another transfer. Doesn&#8217;t go through. Back to&nbsp;operator.</em></p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;m sorry, she&#8217;s out of town for&#8230; ummm&#8230; looks like&nbsp;forever.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Is there anyone else I can speak&nbsp;with?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Ummmm, no. You&#8217;re&nbsp;screwed.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Can you help me at&nbsp;all?</em></p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>No. That&#8217;s not my job. I just transfer phone calls. I am here to make your
life&nbsp;miserable.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Well, tell your supervisor I said you&#8217;re doing an excellent&nbsp;job.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Ummm,&nbsp;<span class="caps">OK</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that entirely useless exchange, I headed over to see if I could have
better luck in person. I did, sort of. I got thrown around a bit from person
to person, but finally one of the bankers helped me. She explained that these
checks were not being deposited in my account immediately because I was a &#8220;new
customer.&#8221; New customer?! I&#8217;ve been banking there for <strong>four years!</strong> And
seriously, Illinois Tech, who&#8217;s writing me the checks, hasn&#8217;t bounced a check
in who-knows-how-long, so what are they worried about? I don&#8217;t know. I hate to
say it, but I gave up. My thirty dollars is gone forever. It just wasn&#8217;t worth
it. I guess I&#8217;ll try to set up direct deposit. But with my luck, they&#8217;ll mess
it up and I&#8217;ll lose the money permanently, or have to wait even longer to have
access to it. I hate&nbsp;banks.</p>
