                </header>
                                    <p>One of the things that really annoys me about iTunes is the lack of
categorical tagging. Actually, I shouldn&#8217;t blame iTunes. I think this is a
fundamental limitation in the <span class="caps">ID3</span> tags. What I want is the ability to &#8220;tag&#8221;
music as I listen to it, with terms like &#8220;story-song&#8221; (songs that tell a
story) or &#8220;ricardo&#8221; (songs that my friend Ricardo has introduced me to).
Social music sites like <a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/">Last.fm</a> have this concept, as
does just about every &#8220;Web 2.0&#8221; site in the world. Why not my music&nbsp;player?</p>
<p>Initially when I tried to implement this sort of thing I used the &#8220;keywords&#8221;
field. I would just add the tag to that field, then I created Smart Playlists
based on that field. <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/itunes/tag-your-songs-in-itunes-153970.php">This post at Lifehacker</a> suggests using the
&#8220;Grouping&#8221; field, but the premise is the&nbsp;same.</p>
<p>This approach works fine until you want to edit a bunch of songs and <strong>add </strong>a
tag. When you do a bulk edit of the keywords field in iTunes it&#8217;ll overwrite
anything that was there previously. So suddenly tagging all that music with
&#8220;<a href="/music/Pages/SasquatchMusicFestival2006.aspx">Sasquatch 2006</a>&#8221; removed all the other cool tags you had applied. Major&nbsp;suckage.</p>
<p>Today I decided to try a new approach: I just use dumb, old-fashioned
playlists. When I want a new tag, I create a new playlist for it. For
organization purposes I keep all tag playlists in a folder called Tags. I can
then create additional nested folders for categories, and because of how
iTunes handles folders with playlists inside, the folders will become
aggregators of all the music in playlists underneath them, which is nifty.
This means I can see all of the music I have tagged just by clicking the Tag&nbsp;folder</p>
<p>This approach is pretty simple. Adding a tag is easy, and using the tags to
drive smart playlists is easy too. Just add an &#8220;If &lt;<strong>Playlist</strong>&gt; &lt;<strong>is/is
not</strong>&gt; &lt;<strong>Tag playlist name</strong>&gt;&#8221; clause to the Smart Playlist. There is a
drawback, though&#8230; <strong>Removing </strong>tags is now a pain. From the frying pan into
the fire&#8230; I have to make sure the song doesn&#8217;t appear multiple times in a
playlist, and if it does, remove all occurrences. This is because playlists
are designed to support multiple occurrences of the same song. If I want to
start and end my playlist with <em>My Heart Will Go On</em>, then dang it, I can do
it. But for my purposes, it&#8217;s not the ideal&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>Anyway, none of this really helps my situation, because the iTunes app
<strong>doesn&#8217;t help me</strong> manage my tags, build playlists based on them, or
anything, natively. All of this is a hack. There are a lot things that it
could do to make it easier to tag music. And with the iTunes music store, what
if I could check out how other users were tagging the track, and borrow their
tags? This is all stuff that is provided by Last.fm, of course, but Last.fm
doesn&#8217;t manage my entire music collection - iTunes&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>And of course <strong>none </strong>of this does anything on my iPod. Heck, <strong>it </strong>can&#8217;t
even understand playlist folders, which is super <em>super <strong>super</strong></em> dumb.
Actually, I have a lot of gripes about the iPod&nbsp;<span class="caps">UI</span>&#8230;</p>

                                    <p>If you browse around the internet these days, you&#8217;re bound to come across a
website that has an intro page. Usually this page allows you to choose whether
you have a high- or low-bandwidth connection. If you select the high-bandwidth
option, you invariably get taken to a Flash version of the site, while the
low-bandwidth version of the site is static&nbsp;<span class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>
<p>When faced with these types of choices, I often forget that one should <em>always
_pick the low-bandwidth option, even if one is using a high-bandwidth
connection. The main reason is that these Flash sites often have annoying
background music or annoying animations. From a site design perspective, Flash
is best used as a _supplementary</em> web technology. A website shouldn&#8217;t be
designed entirely in Flash. Some core reasons for this are accessibility and
search-ability. Google and other spiders cannot crawl a flash web site as
easily. Not to mention the fact that these types of sites always have some
crazy navigation scheme and flashy transitions between sections that make it
very difficult to navigate around, because it doesn&#8217;t fit the typical web
mold. Finally, Flash sites are typically absolutely scaled at a specific
resolution, which means they don&#8217;t look or work great if they&#8217;re not at a
specific window size. To combat this, they&#8217;ll pop open a separate browser
window at the specific size they want. Talk about annoying! There is very
rarely <em>any</em> need at all to design your site in Flash completely. Many 
Flash-only site have a stripped down <span class="caps">HTML</span> version of the site, hence the intro page
where you pick which version you want to see. Since you already have to create
an <span class="caps">HTML</span> version of the site, why not scrap the flash site and focus your
attention on making the <span class="caps">HTML</span> site much&nbsp;better?</p>
<p>The trend of completely Flash-based web sites has declined dramatically in the
commercial web of late, which is a great development. Instead, sites are using
Flash as a way to add a bit of pizzazz to the site in strategic places, or to
add a slightly more interactive portion to their site. Judicious use of Flash
in this way is&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>The next time someone tells you that you should design your entire web
presence in Flash, or have two versions of your site, shoot&nbsp;them.</p>

                                    <p>I had to buy a new tube of toothpaste the other day. This isn&#8217;t something I do
terribly often. I live alone, and even with my braces, which requires a more
stringent dental hygiene regiment, I don&#8217;t go through a tube that&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>But as I browsed the seemingly endless toothpaste section at my local Fred
Meyer, looking for a tube, I realized that I have never bought the same type
of toothpaste twice. I get to the store and I realize that I don&#8217;t know what
type I bought last time, and all of the tubes look the same and have
frustratingly similar names. <em>Did I get Mint Zing last time? Or was it Fresh
Mint? Maybe it was Minty Fresh… Yeah, it was Minty&nbsp;Fresh.</em></p>
<p>Nope, it wasn&#8217;t Minty Fresh. It wasn&#8217;t even Fresh Mint or Mint Zing. It was
<strong>Mega Mint with Scope, Baking Soda and Peroxide Whitening ++</strong>. <em>Sigh</em>. Why
does it have to be so hard to buy freaking&nbsp;toothpaste?</p>

                                    <p>I managed to snag a Wii this past weekend at Target. It was a bit of a chore.
I spent seven hours in 30 degree weather with 20 other brave souls who dared
tochallenge the elements. I brought my heavy coat, a couple of blankets, a
folding chair, and some reading material, and settled in with the other
friendly members of the line around 1 am on a Saturday night. I was 10th in
line, and at about 3am the night shift manager walked out and told us that
they&#8217;d &#8220;probably&#8221; have 21 Wii&#8217;s. The info was accurate, and at 8:30am, a very
tired, cold Tyler walked out of the store with a bundle of Japanese electronic&nbsp;awesomeness.</p>
<p>When I got home I plugged it in and got everything wired up. It was pretty
straightforward. I didn&#8217;t have component cables yet, so I had to use the
composite cable. My gosh, does 480i suck. Ever since I got my new 50&#8221; plasma
last month I haven&#8217;t been able to watch low quality signals for long. I had
initially planned to wait to get the component cable, but I ordered one from
Nintendo the very next day. They must have shipped from Redmond, too, because
I got it the following day, which was awesome. 480p makes the picture less
nauseatingly&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Wiimote is surprisingly easy to set up and use. Just put the
sensor bar in the appropriate location, and you&#8217;re pretty much done. I
expected to have to do some sort of calibration like you do on a <span class="caps">PDA</span> touch
screen, but there wasn&#8217;t any. Mnoving it around to select things on the screen
is easy, and it has a very mouse-like feel. One of the coolest things is that
it can detect the orientation of your hand, so if you hold the Wiimote upside
down, the pointer icon on the screen goes upside down as well. This capability
is important in games too, most notably in Wii Sports Bowling. Pretty cool
stuff from a technological&nbsp;perspective.</p>
<p>I had a ton of problems getting my Wii on the internet, though. I still
haven&#8217;t gotten it working with my own network. I&#8217;m mooching off a neighbor&#8217;s
until I get mine figured out. I keep getting random errors when testing the
connection. The Wii of course just gives you an error code, and then you have
to look it up on their support website to try and figure out what it is. And
then, you have to type in the error code and hit search, because they don&#8217;t
just have a flat list of the codes and what they mean. And to add insult to
injury, they have ranges of error codes that all have the same recommendation.
_Change the wireless channel to 1 or 11. Check your <span class="caps">SSID</span>, blah blah blah.
_None of it has worked for me. This is one area where I think Microsoft really
has it down when you compare the 360 experience to the&nbsp;Wii.</p>
<p>Once I got it online, updating it was painfully slow. It took about a half
hour to get all the updates downloaded and installed. Compare this to the 360,
which has taken less than 3 minutes for every update I&#8217;ve ever&nbsp;applied.</p>
<p>The Wii <span class="caps">UI</span> is very minimalistic. There&#8217;s not a lot of color, just grey, black,
and white, and the occasional blue. And it has this annoying pinging sound
that it makes whenever you&#8217;re applying an update or testing a wireless
connection. It gets to you after awhile. And the Wii Store has this background
music that is fun at first, but you get sick of it real&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>After all of the fooling around with getting it online and updated, I was
pretty frustrated. It took me the better part of the day to get it up and
running. So when I finally decided it was time to play Wii Sports, I was in a
kind of bad mood. But within 5 minutes of standing in front of my <span class="caps">TV</span>,
gesticulating wildly, my attitude had changed. Wii Sports is just freaking
fun! I majorly suck at baseball and tennis, but I bowl pretty well, and I find
boxing pretty fun. It took me awhile to figure out that I could use both hands
while boxing. Yeah, I&#8217;m an&nbsp;idiot.</p>
<p>I also got Zelda, but I haven&#8217;t played it yet. I also have a ton of GameCube
games that I haven&#8217;t tried yet. That is one really cool thing &#8211; my Wavebirds
are still useable, as are my memory cards with all my save games. I could
fully retire my GameCube if it weren&#8217;t for the Gameboy Player, which I use to
play Gameboy games on the big&nbsp;screen.</p>
<p>I still have a lot of stuff to check out. I added Patrick to my address book
(seriously, this is a painful experience compared to the Xbox Live accounts
and friends list. A 16 digit number? Come on! I can&#8217;t remember that to tell my
friends!), so hopefully we&#8217;ll be exchanging Mii&#8217;s soon. Not sure what that
means, but no doubt it will be a cultural&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that this console was designed by a Japanese company. The design
and focus are very different from something like the 360. And that is awesome!
Variety is good. I look forward to better online experiences as they roll out
new services and channels. There&#8217;s a lot of potential, and just like Xbox
Live, it&#8217;s going to take some time to really&nbsp;grow.</p>
<p>Until then, anybody up for a round of Wii&nbsp;Bowling?</p>

                                    <p>A lot of people have made a big deal about the limitations of the <a href="http://www.zune.net/">Zune</a>
wireless functionality since it was released a few weeks ago. While I totally
agree that there is a lot of untapped potential with the device currently,
there is at least one &#8220;obvious&#8221; omission that people have pointed out that
simply isn&#8217;t a good idea, to be&nbsp;honest.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about syncing to the device using the wireless. Sounds cool,
right? You just walk into your apartment, turn on the Zune, and Boom! All of
your music is synchronized to it. But what people don&#8217;t seem to realize is how
slow this would be. The maximum bandwidth for <span class="caps">USB</span> 2.0 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_2.0#Transfer_speed">480 Mbit/s</a>, or
60 <span class="caps">MB</span>/s. 802.11g, on the other hand, has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11g#802.11g">maximum raw data rate of 54
Mbit/s</a>, or about 24.7 Mbit/s net throughput. Now, by applying some simple&nbsp;mathematics:</p>
<p>480 / 24.7 =&nbsp;19.4332</p>
<p>This means that syncing to your device using wireless would be roughly 20
times slower than using <span class="caps">USB</span> 2.0. Even if we assume the theoretical max data
rate for 802.11g, which isn&#8217;t realistic, to be clear, you&#8217;re still looking at
a transfer speed that&#8217;s ten times slower. And don&#8217;t even think about using
802.11b. Frankly, this doesn&#8217;t sound like a good&nbsp;idea.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>So what?&#8221; you say. &#8220;I can leave the Zune syncing all night and it&#8217;ll be ready
to go in the morning. Speed isn&#8217;t a real issue.&#8221; <span class="caps">OK</span>, fine. You walk into your
apartment, you turn on your Zune, and it starts syncing. You go to bed. You
wake up the next morning, and your Zune is finished syncing, but it&#8217;s battery
has also been drained. Good luck using it on your&nbsp;commute.</p>
<p>So what do you do next time? You plug it in so it can charge while it&#8217;s
syncing. But at this point, why not just plug it directly into your computer
to sync and charge at the same time, at a much faster rate? So to me, it&#8217;s
clear that isn&#8217;t really a desirable feature, and I&#8217;ll bet that some Program
Manager on the Zune team came to the same&nbsp;conclusion.</p>
<p>One thing that I will point out, however, is that many times, when you sync,
you&#8217;re not syncing that much data. Your library hasn&#8217;t changed that much, and
the only thing that&#8217;s being synced is play counts or updated track info or
something. In that case, this feature might make sense. The amount of data
wouldn&#8217;t be large, so the process wouldn&#8217;t take long and the battery drain
would be minimal. There might be some scenarios where this feature would be
useful. However, I think that a lot of people had a knee-jerk reaction and
haven&#8217;t really thought through the ramifications and technical limitations of
that feature. But hey, that&#8217;s what we <span class="caps">PM</span>&#8217;s get paid for, right?&nbsp;:-)</p>
